Conway's Game of Life
=====================

A solution among many produced during [Global Coderetreat Day 2017](http://coderetreat.gr/) at Thessaloniki, Greece. 

The problem was solved by everyone and in many different ways using completely different approaches, technologies and real life restrictions and scenarios, thus promoting the benefits of cooperation and cumulative brain power.

Instructions
------------
1. Press 'r' to set some random cells to be alive ( or click on the grid to set that one alive)
2. Press 's' to start simulating
3. Press 'e' to stop and retry (goto 1)

Hint: You can click or press 'r' at any time during the simulation.

(*User interaction and tidying was made after the event. If loading is too slow, try changing Consts.CellSize a bit!*)
