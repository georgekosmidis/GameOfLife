Conway's Game of Life
=====================

Started as a [Global Coderetreat Day 2017](http://coderetreat.gr/) coding game, refactored later. 

*You can find the initial push here: https://github.com/georgekosmidis/GameOfLife/tree/GlobalCoderetreatDay*

Instructions
------------
1. Press 'r' to set some random cells to be alive ( or click on the grid to set that one alive)
2. Press 's' to start simulating
3. Press 'e' to stop and retry (goto 1)

Hint: You can click or press 'r' at any time during the simulation.

(*User interaction and tidying was made after the event. If loading is too slow, try changing Consts.CellSize a bit!*)
